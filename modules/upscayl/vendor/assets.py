"""Assets: saved reusable logic, as a first-class object type (P038).

**One implementation, many owners, and that is the whole point of this file.** An
asset is *a* way logic moves between modules (D1/D2), and every module that wants to
own assets carries a **byte-identical copy** of this file under its own ``vendor/`` --
the same answer ``vendor/semver.py``, ``vendor/logsink.py`` and ``vendor/guard.py``
already give, for the same reason: *a module cannot borrow the core's anything.* Not
its URL, not its ``sys.path``, and not its language. A test compares the bytes
(``tests/test_assets.py``).

The top of this file is **stdlib only**, so a module that serves with Starlette, with
``http.server``, or with nothing at all can hold an :class:`AssetStore`. The one
FastAPI-shaped convenience, :func:`mount_asset_api`, imports FastAPI *inside itself*,
so importing this module never drags a web framework in.

## The shape (D3): a thin envelope over an opaque module payload

An asset record is an **envelope** the core (and any consumer) understands, wrapped
around a **payload** that belongs to the owning module and is **never parsed here**.
The store reads and writes the payload as bytes-of-JSON; it does not know or care what
is in it. Organisation is **tags plus a saving convention** (D3), never a fixed
taxonomy -- different modules have genuinely different asset use-cases, and installing
a new module widens the space again.

The **legible** part of the envelope is a typed **socket interface** in P001's
``SocketSpec`` vocabulary (D4) -- inputs and outputs, each a ``{name, type, ...}``
object whose ``type`` is one of the graph editor's socket type strings (``any``,
``str``, ``int``, ``float``, ``bool``, ``model``, ``bundle``, ``list[...]``). This is
what lets a wiring against an asset be validated *before it runs*. We store the socket
dicts and validate them shallowly (a ``name`` that is an identifier, a non-empty
``type`` string); we do **not** import ``SocketSpec`` -- reusing the *vocabulary* does
not mean importing the *type*, and the core imports nothing from the engine any more
than from a module.

## Ownership and the version stamp

* **Each module owns its own assets (D5).** They live under
  ``HDECK_DATA_DIR/module_data/<owner>/assets/<id>.json`` -- the per-module runtime
  directory D24 placed there, never inside the module's own installed directory (which
  is packed and hashed, so a write there breaks ``modules verify``). The library is a
  *view* over these, not a second store.
* **``origin`` is ``ingested`` or ``authored`` (D9/D38)** -- deliberately not
  *provenance*, which is a word that belongs to modules (P040). An asset ingested from
  something (a captured CLI ``--help``, a PowerShell function) versus one a human
  authored by hand.
* **``kind`` says which convention the payload follows (P097).** An **open registry,
  never an enum**: the envelope checks that it is a lexically sane string and carries
  the meaning verbatim, exactly as the core carries socket keys it does not understand.
  ``WELL_KNOWN_KINDS`` below is *documentation*, not a gate -- any module may coin one,
  and a value nothing here has heard of is accepted. This **narrows D3 rather than
  reversing it**: there is still no fixed taxonomy, and organisation is still tags plus
  a saving convention; what there is now is a registry a reader can check against
  instead of a convention nothing can.

  **A kind is recorded at ingestion and never inferred from payload shape.** The source
  knows: an MCP server states that its tools are tools, a CLI's ``--help`` states that
  its options are options. Sniffing a payload later is guessing at something that was
  thrown away.

  **It is not what interoperability rests on.** ``interface`` is -- it is typed and
  validated and it is what a compiler consumes. ``kind`` answers only *"which convention
  does this opaque payload follow"*, which matters the moment a module reads a payload
  it did not write. Absent means unknown, and a pre-``kind`` asset therefore still loads
  unchanged: this added an optional field with a documented absent value, which is not
  a breaking change, so ``ASSET_API_VERSION`` did not move.
* **``captured_against`` stamps the owner-module version the asset was captured
  against.** Assets carry no semver of their own (D6), but their owner module does
  (P022), and nothing else detects the drift between them -- the highest-severity gap
  the design log named, because it surfaces at run time in someone else's graph. The
  stamp is the cheap half of the fix (``decisions.md``, 2026-09-12): a consumer that
  knows the owner's *current* version can compare, and say "this asset was made for
  cli_apps 0.4.0, you have 0.5.0" as a **warning**, rather than trusting it silently.
  Making the mismatch legible is the point; blocking on it is not.
